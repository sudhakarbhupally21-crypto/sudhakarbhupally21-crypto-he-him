## 🚀 Selected Projects

---

### 1. Sales & Logistics Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

* **Interactive dashboard** tracking regional sales, product performance, and revenue trends for an e-commerce platform (**Shop Nest**).
* Identified a strong **negative correlation** between increased order processing/fulfillment delay and customer satisfaction/repeat purchase rates using **Statistical Modeling (Regression Analysis)**.
* Developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard that provided real-time visibility into logistics bottlenecks and delay impacts, recommending **targeted process improvements** for high-delay regions.

---

### 2. Transaction Latency & Failure Analysis (Excel + Statistical Modeling)

* Analyzed UPI payment transaction logs for **PhonePe** to isolate failure rates by time of day, day of week, bank partner, and transaction type.
* Pinpointed specific banks and system bottlenecks responsible for a critical spike in payment failure rates (**up to 25% increase**) during weekend peak hours.
* The recommendations led to targeted capacity planning and re-routing strategies, projecting a **1.8 percentage point reduction** in peak-hour transaction failure rate (a **25% reduction** in the failure spike).

### 3. Employee Performance Modeling & Talent Pipeline (Python)

* Built a quantifiable performance model using **Python (Pandas, Numpy)** to compare employee performance based on project completion rate versus target timelines.
* Utilized Python to process and merge diverse employee project datasets, handling missing values and standardizing time-to-completion metrics.
* Enabled the identification of the **top 15%** of high-potential employees who consistently outperformed time metrics, streamlining the talent pipeline for leadership roles.
